# C_Sharp-Interpreter
Conscience is the perfect interpreter of life. 
- Karl Barth

My C#-Interpreter interprets C# statements by converting it to .NET lambda expressions or delegates.

Using this C#-Interpreter developers can create scriptable applications, execute .NET code without compilation or create dynamic linq statements.

Statements are written using a subset of C# language specifications. Global variables or parameters can be injected and used inside expressions. It doesn't generate assembly but it creates an expression tree on the fly.
